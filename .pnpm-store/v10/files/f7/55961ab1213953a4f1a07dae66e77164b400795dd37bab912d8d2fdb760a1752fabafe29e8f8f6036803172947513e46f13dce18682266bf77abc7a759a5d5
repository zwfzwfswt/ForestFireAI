 * Build a birpc `ChannelOptions` object backed by an SSE stream (server →

 * to `createWsRpcChannel`, wire-compatible with `attachSseRpcTransport`.
 *
 * The stream is consumed via `fetch` streaming (not `EventSource`), so it
 * works in browsers and server runtimes alike. The server's first frame
 * (`event: session`) carries the session id; every `POST` echoes it in the
 * `x-birpc-session` header. A response to a client-initiated request comes
 * back in the `POST`'s own body and is re-injected into the channel; a
 * dropped stream terminates the channel; there is no reconnect, matching
 * the WS channel's closed-is-done semantics.
