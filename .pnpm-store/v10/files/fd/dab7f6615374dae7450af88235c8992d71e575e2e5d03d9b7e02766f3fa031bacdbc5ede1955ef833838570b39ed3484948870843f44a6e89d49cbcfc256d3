 *
 * The IPv4 case is matched **structurally**: the whole hostname must be a

 * the loopback origin gate that guards the RPC/MCP surface (a DNS-rebinding /
 * cross-site WebSocket-hijacking bypass). Requiring a real IPv4 literal keeps
 * genuine loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`, `127.5.5.5`) allowed while rejecting
 * those DNS names.
