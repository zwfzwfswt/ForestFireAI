 * @note Available only on srvx's Node.js adapter — on Node.js, or on Deno (2.8+) via `node:https`. It is **not** available on Bun: neither native `Bun.serve` nor Bun's `node:http(s)` server exposes the peer certificate to the handler (they enforce `requestCert` / `rejectUnauthorized` at the handshake, but drop the certificate), so unlike Deno the `srvx/node` adapter is not a workaround. Verified against the real Bun runtime (Bun 1.3.14); `bun vitest` without the `--bun` flag silently falls back to Node, which can mask this. See https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/16254

/**
 * Mutual TLS (mTLS) plugin for the Node.js adapter.

 * Requests a client certificate during the TLS handshake and exposes it — together
 * with the negotiated protocol and cipher — on {@link ServerRequestTLS | `request.tls`}.
 *
 * Only srvx's Node.js adapter can deliver this (`import { serve } from "srvx/node"`),
 * on Node.js or Deno (via `node:https`). Native `Deno.serve` / `Bun.serve` and Bun's
 * `node:http(s)` server do not expose the peer certificate, so the plugin throws there
 * rather than silently doing nothing. It also requires the server to be configured for
 * TLS (`tls.cert` / `tls.key`) and throws otherwise, since mutual TLS cannot run over
 * plain HTTP. A request that still reaches the plugin over a plain socket (TLS dropped
 * after construction by an outer host) is answered with `496` rather than run.
 *
 * With the default `rejectUnauthorized: true`, unauthenticated clients are rejected
 * during the TLS handshake and never reach the `fetch` handler. Set it to `false` to
 * let every handshake complete and enforce authorization yourself via
 * `request.tls.authorized`, as in the example below.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * import { serve } from "srvx/node";
 * import { mtlsPlugin } from "srvx/mtls";
 *
 * serve({
 *   tls: { cert, key },
 *   plugins: [mtlsPlugin({ ca, requestCert: true, rejectUnauthorized: false })],
 *   fetch: (request) => {
 *     if (!request.tls?.authorized) {
 *       return new Response("client certificate required", { status: 401 });
 *     }
 *     return new Response(`Hello, ${request.tls.peerCertificate?.subject?.CN}`);
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
