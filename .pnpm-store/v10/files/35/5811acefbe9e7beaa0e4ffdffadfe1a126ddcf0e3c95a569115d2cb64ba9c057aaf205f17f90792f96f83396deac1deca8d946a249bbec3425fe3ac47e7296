//#region src/events.ts
/**
* Centralized registry of the core devframe event names: the node-side host
* bus events, the client RPC connection events, and the server→client
* broadcast notifications, so these names live in one place instead of
* scattered string literals.
*
* **Keep this in sync with [`docs/content/8.references/3.events.md`](../../../docs/content/8.references/3.events.md)**
* (the "Core devframe events" section): every name here appears in that page's
* tables, and every name there resolves to an entry here. Add, rename, or
* remove a name in both places in the same change, and reference
* `DEVFRAME_EVENTS.*` from call sites instead of re-typing a literal.
*
* This map covers **notifications** (events, broadcasts). The request/response
* RPC endpoints of the shared-state, streaming, and auth-handshake protocols
* (`devframe:rpc:server-state:*`, `devframe:streaming:subscribe`,
* `anonymous:devframe:auth`, …) are defined at their handlers and typed in
* `types/rpc-augments.ts`; they aren't events and stay out of this map.
*
* The `EventEmitter` maps (`RpcClientEvents`, `DevframeAgentHostEvents`) and the
* `DevframeRpcClientFunctions` augmentation declare these names as type-level
* keys (a literal is unavoidable in a type position); those declarations mirror
* this map and move with it.
